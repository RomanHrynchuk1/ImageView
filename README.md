This is a Qt project to automatically detect the change of a local file.

**QFileSystemWatcher** monitors the file system for changes to files and directories by watching a list of specified paths. Call addPath() to watch a particular file or directory. Multiple paths can be added using the addPaths() function. Existing paths can be removed by using the removePath() and removePaths() functions.
